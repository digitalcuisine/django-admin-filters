django-admin-filters
====================

Just a simple collection of useful generic admin filters.

We do not work much with Django and have not been for long, but we found ourselves using the same patterns over and over again in client projects, for filters in the admin app for instance.

This repository is a collection of base filter classes that can be used to speed up implementation of filter classes for your models in a Django Admin app.
